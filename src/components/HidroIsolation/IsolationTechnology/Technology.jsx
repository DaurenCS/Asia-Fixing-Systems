                <h3><b>WHAT IS CSH TECHNOLOGY</b></h3>
                <p>CSH technology is based on waterproofing concrete by crystallization and improving its properties to achieve greater durability. <br /> <br />

In general, concrete when exposed to water or humidity undergoes a series of chemical reactions that cause faster deterioration and leaks.<br /> <br />

Thanks to Krystaline’s CSH technology, when concrete comes into contact with water it produces millions of insoluble crystals of calcium silicate hydrates that plug the capillary network. This permanently reduces the permeability of the concrete.<br /> <br />

The greatest virtue of this waterproofing system is that it does not try to ac as a physical barrier against water, it penetrates the concrete and seeks it out, becoming its ally. In other words, it is hydrophilic, not hydrophobic. Water enhances its effectiveness. In addition, Krystaline does not wear out and does not run out, it is a catalyst.<br /> <br />

The hydrophilic reaction also has the advantage of self-repairing shrinkage cracks and any cracks that may appear even years later. In this way we will always have an ultra waterproof concrete with a better appearance and more strength, protecting the entire structure against external chemical agents and giving it greater durability and sustainability.</p>

                <h3><b>USES OF CSH TECHNOLOGY BY KRYSTALINE</b></h3>
                <p>
                Waterproofing of new buildings: Admixtures for new structures
By using Krystaline as an admixture, a waterproofed concrete structure with crystalline technology is achieved natively. From the beginning of the concrete’s life, crystallization remains active in the structure.  This property remains latent for the entire life of the concrete. We could say that Krystaline admixtures ally with water, when it appears, to waterproof and protect the concrete.

Concrete repair solution: waterproofing mortars
They are used to protect or repair concrete constructions that are degraded or mainly subject to the presence of water.

Unlike other technologies, repair products (waterproofing mortars) do not only form a surface barrier. In the presence of water, Krystaline penetrates by adsorption and thanks to its catalytic nature, it penetrates further and further to waterproof the concrete throughout its thickness. In this way, we achieve the same benefits as our admixtures for existing structures.

With sufficient time, the surface application can even be removed, leaving the concrete substrate waterproofed.

In short, it is a latent technology that reacts to the presence of water throughout the life cycle of the concrete, achieving permanent results in its application.
